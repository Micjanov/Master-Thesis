\section{Bag-of-words}
In chapter~\ref{ssec:protclas}, a method of embedding sequences of amino acids has already been discussed. Here, a sequence of amino acids is considered to be a bag of k-mers. Within a k-mer, the amino acids (presented as randomly generated hyperdimensional vectors) are bonded together with sequential information included. All possible k-mers are all then bundled together, the result is then a hyperdimensional vector representing the whole sequence.
