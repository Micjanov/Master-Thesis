\section{Bag-of-words}
In chapter~\ref{ssec:protclas}, a method of embedding sequences of amino acids has already been discussed. Here, a sequence of amino acids is considered to be a bag of k-mers. Within a k-mer, the amino acids (presented as randomly generated hyperdimensional vectors) are bonded together with sequential information included. All possible k-mers are all then bundled together, the result is then a hyperdimensional vector representing the whole sequence.

\section{Convolutional embedding}
Here, we introduce a novel sequence embedding method within the framework of hyperdimensional computing. It is similar to the bag-of-words method in the sense that it bundles vectors of k-mers, but here the k-mer's positional information will be encoded into the k-mer before bundling. insert picture
