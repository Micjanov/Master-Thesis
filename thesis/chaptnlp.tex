\section{State-of-the-art protein language modeling}
It is intuitive to represent a protein as a sequence of letters with each letter corresponding to an amino acid. Likewise natural languages, we can find common elements between naturally evolved proteins. Noticeable patterns reoccurring in multiple (related) protein sequences are highly likely to be biologically relevant. These motifs and domains are essential to many biological processes and can easily be represented as words, phrases or sentences of amino acids in a language model perspective. This is why researchers are taking inspiration from natural language processing (NLP) and applying this to a biological context.
